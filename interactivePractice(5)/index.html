                Jewellery (British English) or jewelry (American English)[1] consists of 
                small decorative items worn for personal adornment, such as brooches, rings, 
                necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks. Jewellery may be attached 
                to the body or the clothes. From a western perspective, the term is restricted to 
                durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal, often 
                combined with gemstones, has been the normal material for jewellery, but other materials 
                such as shells and other plant materials may be used. It is one of the oldest type of
                 archaeological artefact – with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells thought to 
                 be the oldest known jewellery.[2] The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures.
